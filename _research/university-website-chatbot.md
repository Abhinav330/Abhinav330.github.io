# Abstract:
University websites have become essential tools for giving information to diverse audiences, including prospective students, faculty, and stakeholders. However, the usability and efficiency of these platforms often fall short, with users meeting challenges such as complex navigation, fragmented information, and a lack of personalisation. Recent studies emphasise these shortcomings, highlighting how inadequate information quality (Mogaji et al., 2020) and poorly designed search interfaces (Munoz et al., 2019) hinder decision-making and engagement. Integrating AI-powered solutions, such as chatbots, offers a promising avenue to address these issues by providing real-time, interactive assistance. This research focuses on developing an AI-driven chatbot to enhance the university website user experience, particularly in accessing course-related information. Leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, the chatbot dynamically retrieves and generates contextually relevant responses to user queries. Previous research underscores the potential of AI in education, with studies exploring chatbot adoption factors (Mohd Rahim et al., 2022), pedagogical implications (Klímová and Ibna Seraj, 2023), and their effectiveness in delivering personalised learning experiences (Pérez et al., 2020). However, gaps persist in aligning chatbot capabilities with user needs, particularly in addressing complex queries and ensuring accurate, domain-specific responses. To bridge these gaps, this project employed a structured methodology encompassing data collection, fine-tuning of LLMs, and the implementation of RAG to enhance response precision. Data scraping techniques were used to extract comprehensive course details from the University of Westminster’s website, creating a robust dataset for training the chatbot. Fine-tuned models, including Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and Llama-3.2, were evaluated using metrics such as ScarBLEU, CER, and Meteor, ensuring optimal performance in terms of accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance. The RAG framework further augmented the chatbot’s ability to provide accurate and up-to-date responses by integrating external knowledge dynamically. The results demonstrate significant advancements in user experience, with the chatbot addressing critical issues identified in prior studies, such as fragmented information and inconsistent interfaces (Nachmias and Segev, 2003; Wood, 2020). By offering accurate, context-aware responses, the chatbot not only improves information accessibility but also sets a foundation for future research in AI-driven educational tools. This project bridges the gap between technological capabilities and user expectations, aligning with broader trends in enhancing academic digital services (Mardalena and Andryani, 2021). In conclusion, this research highlights the transformative potential of generative AI and RAG in reshaping how educational institutions interact with their stakeholders, addressing longstanding challenges in usability and information delivery.

# Chapter 1: Introduction
The digital age has significantly reshaped the higher education landscape, with university websites becoming indispensable tools for information dissemination. These platforms cater to diverse audiences, including prospective students, current enrollers, faculty members, and institutional stakeholders. Despite their importance, numerous studies have highlighted persistent challenges associated with university websites, ranging from difficult navigation and fragmented data to poor search functionalities and a lack of user engagement (Mogaji et al., 2020; Nachmias and Segev, 2003). Such limitations impede users' ability to access critical information and adversely impact decision-making processes, particularly for prospective students considering enrolment options. Educational institutions have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to address these challenges. Chatbots have emerged as powerful tools that enhance user interaction by offering real-time, personalized assistance. Unlike traditional interfaces, AI-driven chatbots provide dynamic and context-aware responses, transforming how users access information. However, while chatbots have gained traction across various industries, their application in higher education remains underexplored. Existing implementations often rely on basic models with limited capacity to understand complex queries or adapt to the evolving needs of users, leaving significant gaps in functionality and user satisfaction.

This dissertation investigates the development of an AI-powered chatbot explicitly designed for university websites, focusing on improving access to course-related information. By leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and Llama-3.2, this project aims to address critical shortcomings in existing systems. Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) further enhances the chatbot’s ability to donate, retrieve and generate accurate, domain-specific responses dynamically from prior research on chatbot adoption in educational settings (Mohd Rahim et al., 2022; Pérez et al., 2020), this study explores the transformative potential of generative AI in improving user experience on academic platforms. The objectives of this research are threefold: to design and implement a chatbot capable of providing precise and contextually relevant course information; to evaluate the chatbot’s performance using advanced metrics such as ScarBLEU, CER, and Meteor; and to demonstrate its potential to enhance digital interactions in higher education. By addressing the gaps identified in existing literature, this project aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on AI applications in academia, paving the way for more accessible and user-friendly educational platforms.

# Chapter 2: Background
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in higher education has emerged as a transformative approach to addressing longstanding challenges in information accessibility and user engagement. University websites, serving as the primary touchpoints for disseminating course-related information, often fall short in meeting user expectations. Studies have consistently highlighted issues such as inadequate information quality, fragmented data, and poor usability, which hinder prospective students and other stakeholders from effectively accessing critical details (Mogaji et al., 2020; Nachmias and Segev, 2003). To address these issues, AI-powered chatbots have gained significant attention in recent years. Early implementations focused on rule-based systems with limited functionality, but Natural Language Processing (NLP) advancements have shifted the focus to more sophisticated models. Research by Munoz et al. (2019) underscores the importance of intuitive, user-friendly designs in chatbot interfaces, while Mohd Rahim et al. (2022) emphasize factors influencing chatbot adoption, including trust, interactivity, and performance expectancy. These studies highlight the potential of AI in improving user interactions and delivering personalized, context-aware assistance. Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a significant leap forward in chatbot capabilities. Models such as GPT, BERT, and their successors have demonstrated understanding and generating human-like responses, enabling more dynamic and adaptive user interactions. These models can be customized to address specific domains, such as education by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and fine-tuning techniques. For instance, Klímová and Ibna Seraj (2023) explored the pedagogical implications of chatbots in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom, finding improvements in student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes. Similarly, Pérez et al. (2020) identified chatbots as effective educational agents capable of providing tailored learning experiences akin to human tutors.

However, the adoption of LLMs in educational chatbots is not without challenges. Issues such as hallucinations, where models generate inaccurate or fabricated information, pose significant risks to reliability (Athaluri et al., 2023). Ethical data privacy and transparency concerns must be addressed to ensure responsible implementation. Research by Gordon and Berhow (2009) highlights the importance of aligning chatbot functionalities with user needs, emphasizing the role of dialogic features in building trust and engagement.

This research builds on existing literature to develop a domain-specific chatbot for university websites, focusing on course-related information. By incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, the chatbot dynamically integrates external knowledge into its responses, addressing limitations in static pre-trained models. The findings of this study contribute to a growing understanding of how AI and generative models can transform information delivery in higher education, aligning technological capabilities with user expectations and institutional goals.

#### 3.2.1.1.	Factors Influencing Chatbot Adoption: 
A study focusing on adopting AI-based chatbots in Malaysian universities highlighted that perceived trust, influenced by interactivity, design, and ethics, plays a crucial role in the behavioural intention to use chatbots. Additionally, performance expectancy and habit were significant predictors of chatbot adoption in the educational context (Mohd Rahim et al., 2022). Another study explored the role of perceived convenience and enhanced performance in adopting chatbots for learning among university students, emphasising the importance of these factors in making learning more effective (Malik et al., 2021). Furthermore, the acceptance of ChatGPT by university students was influenced by experience, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit, indicating that these factors are critical in shaping user behaviour towards chatbot adoption (Romero et al., 2023).

#### 3.2.1.2.	Pedagogical Implications and Learning Outcomes: 
The integration of chatbots in educational settings has significant pedagogical implications and can positively impact learning outcomes. A mini-review on using chatbots in university EFL (English as a Foreign Language) settings found that chatbots enhance effectiveness, motivation, satisfaction, exposure, and assessment in language learning. The study also highlighted the potential of chatbots to apply and integrate existing theories and concepts used in EFL teaching, such as CEFR and self-regulatory learning theory, thereby contributing to more effective teaching and learning (Klímová and Ibna Seraj, 2023). Another study proposed a theoretical framework for blended learning with intelligent chatbots, facilitating interactive learning experiences and helping instructors manage courses more efficiently. This framework underscores the transformative potential of AI chatbots in education and their ability to enhance the overall educational experience (Ilieva et al., 2023). A systematic literature review also identified that chatbots could function as educational agents, providing personalised learning experiences like human tutors, which can significantly improve learning outcomes (Pérez, Daradoumis and Puig, 2020).

#### 3.2.1.3.	Academic Advising and Library Services: 
Chatbots have also been explored for their potential in academic advising and library services. A study on robo-academic advisors reviewed the literature on chatbots and AI in auto-advising systems, finding that chatbots can effectively balance personalised student advising with automation. The study emphasised the need for more empirical research to understand the effectiveness of chatbots in academic advising and how they can be integrated into educational settings (Mohammed Muneerali Thottoli, Badria Hamed Alruqaishi and Arockiasamy Soosaimanickam, 2024). In the context of academic libraries, a qualitative study explored the perceived risks and challenges of adopting chatbots. The findings suggested that stakeholders, including library staff, doctoral students, and faculty, generally Favor the adoption of chatbots, as they believe these tools can enhance library services and support research and scholarly communication. However, concerns about privacy and the chatbots' ability to comprehend complex tasks were highlighted as issues that need to be addressed (Kaushal and Yadav, 2022). Another review of the opportunities and challenges of chatbots in education noted that chatbots could significantly improve library services by providing real-time assistance and information to users, thereby enhancing the overall user experience (Hwang and Chang, 2021).

### 3.1.2.	Techniques and Methodologies
The development of university chatbots has leveraged various techniques, ranging from natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks to hybrid modelling approaches and pedagogical frameworks. NLP is pivotal in enabling chatbots to interpret and generate human-like responses. For instance, Bhartiya et al. (2019) describe an auto-reply bot for university counselling that uses NLP on JSON-formatted university data. The chatbot employs a feedforward neural network, addressing challenges such as overfitting to enhance response accuracy. Similarly, Mangotra et al. (2024) explore two deep learning models—a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a simple feedforward neural network—for a chatbot answering university-related queries. Their study underscores the significance of self-curated datasets and NLP preprocessing for handling raw data effectively. Another survey by Rakesh et al. (2022) highlights the role of NLP in creating an academic chatbot capable of addressing academic and non-academic queries and ensuring instant access to relevant information. Beyond NLP and neural networks, hybrid models have been employed to understand factors influencing chatbot adoption in higher education institutions (HEIs). Mohd Rahim et al.

The ethical and legal implications of using AI in academic settings also require further exploration. The potential for AI to worsen inequalities and the need for transparent disclosure of AI assistance in research are critical issues raised (Lin, 2023; Lund et al., 2023).s Addressing these concerns is essential to ensure AI’s responsible and fair use in education.

##### 3.3.2.3.	Domain-Specific Adaptation
While generative AI models offer flexibility, their adaptation to specific domains often creates a trade-off between flexibility and correctness. The limited amount of domain-specific data can constrain the accuracy of the responses generated by these models, highlighting the need for more robust training datasets and improved adaptation techniques (Wölfel et al., 2023).

### 3.3.3.	Future Directions and Potential Solutions
One promising solution to address the issue of hallucination in generative AI is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tuning. RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models by incorporating a retrieval component that fetches relevant information from a large corpus of documents, which the generative model then uses to produce more accurate and reliable outputs. Recent studies have shown that implementation of RAG tuning can improve the performance of AI by 33% to 42%. This approach can significantly reduce the likelihood of hallucinations and improve the overall reliability of AI-generated content (I et al., 2023).

## 3.4.	Conclusion.
In conclusion, while university websites have come a long way, they still need help finding relevant information, like inaccurate search results and difficulty finding relevant information, which can frustrate users. Previous studies have looked at AI solutions, such as chatbots. Still, many of these systems use basic models that do not handle complex user queries or the constantly changing nature of educational content well. This project aims to bridge that gap by creating an AI-powered chatbot using advanced large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. This work builds on existing research by improving how information is retrieved and providing more accurate, context-aware responses. It addresses the shortcomings of current university websites, improving the user experience.
